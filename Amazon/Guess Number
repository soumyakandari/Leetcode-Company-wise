We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

#USING BINARY SEARCH
T.C-O(LOGN)
S.C-O(1)

JAVA CODE:
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
      int lo=1,high=n;
        while(lo<=high)
        {
            int mid= lo+(high-lo)/2;
            if(guess(mid)==0)
                return mid;
        if(guess(mid)<0)
             high=mid-1;
        else
            lo=mid+1;
            
            
            
            
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
